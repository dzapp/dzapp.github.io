											<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
										</header>
<h2>What can I expect during my first visit?</h2>

<p>You can expect to spend some time going over your medical history, sharing your reason(s) for seeking treatment and answering any questions that concern you. You will receive a one-on-one individualized session and then plan out a treatment plan. All information you shared written and verbally with Essential MFR will be strictly confidential.</p>

<h2>How much do your services cost?</h2>

<p>An initial 75 minute visit (evaluation and treatment) costs $125. Follow-up sessions are based at $100 per hour per treatment (package discount available).</p>

<h2>Do you participate with insurance plans?</h2>

<p>Essential MFR does not participate or file with any insurance plans.</p>

<h2>Will my sessions be discussed with anyone outside Essential MFR?</h2>

<p>No! All documents, treatments, discussions etc are COMPLETELY confidential. Like Vegas, what happens in your treatment room, stays in your treatment room. This is governed by HIPPA laws and enforced in the office so you can be totally free to heal without embarrassment or feeling inhibited to let yourself go.</p>

<h2>What forms of payment do you accept?</h2>

<p>Essential MFR accepts cash and personal checks, as forms of payment for all services and supplies. We are unable to accept post-dated checks and there is a $25 service charge for all checked returned for Insufficient Funds.</p>

<h2>How many appointments will I need?</h2>

<p>Results of treatments may vary with each individual, but generally goals can be reached within 4 to 12 weeks of treatment by receiving 1-2 sessions a week. Chronic and more severe conditions will require greater frequency and increased length of treatment.</p>

<h2>What if I need to cancel or reschedule my appointment?</h2>

<p>Essential MFR requires a 24-hour notification for all scheduled appointments that need to be cancelled or rescheduled. Patients who are unable to give 24-hours notice will be charged a cancellation fee equal to their scheduled appointment fee. Payment or arrangement for payment must be made prior to additional appointments being scheduled. Essential MFR prides itself in being able to accommodate patients as soon as possible. Missed appointments takes away from its ability to achieve this goal.</p>

<h2>What if I am late for my appointment?</h2>

<p>You can expect that your session will start and end on time. Please extend to Essential MFR the courtesy of your call if you will be late. When you arrive you will receive the remainder of your time but will be liable for payment in full.</p>

<h2>What are your office hours?</h2>

<p>All sessions are by appointment. Appointments can be scheduled for the following: Monday/Tuesday&nbsp;9:30a-8p, &nbsp;&amp; Thursday 8am-6pm, Friday 9:30pm-6pm and Sunday 10a-5p</p>

<p>If you require an appointment during non-office hours, we may be able to accommodate your need; however, a $10 additional fee will be added to your treatment fee for this accommodation.</p>

<h2>Do I need to bring anything?</h2>

<p>Yes. You will need a pair of gym shorts and ladies will also need a sport-type bra or a two-piece swimsuit for orthopedic services because they are performed table top. Massage therapy sessions for maximum comfortability clothing is not required and preformed under a sheet or towel.</p>

<h2>Do you except gratuity?</h2>

<p>Where as it is customary to tip for massage services at a salon or spa, the gesture of gratuity is much appreciated, but unnecessary at Essential MFR... but of course, if you insist.</p>

<h2>Do you offer any referral incentives?</h2>

<p>We offer a "3-in-3" program that can help you earn FREE treatments! When you refer 3 new individuals within any consecutive 3 month period, you will get a gift certificate for a FREE one hour MFR treatment!</p>
