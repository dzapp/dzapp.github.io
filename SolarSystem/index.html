									</header>
									<p>Jupiter is largest planet in our solar system, the Milky Way. It is the fifth planet from the sun and the first of the gas giants. In between Jupiter and the sun is 498,710,653 miles of space including all the inner planets and the asteroid belt. Compared to Earth, Jupiter is 11.2 times larger in diameter. It would take about 640 days (over 1.5 years) to get to Jupiter from Earth, a distance spanning 365,366 miles. Once there, a traveler would experience being among four different layers of the atmosphere: the Exosphere, Thermosphere, Stratosphere, and Troposphere in the center. Hydrogen and Helium are the two gasses that make up most of Jupiter's atmosphere. Each layer is categorized by its pressure and temperature. In the Stratosphere and Thermosphere ammonia clouds form, creating distinct lightning throughout the planet. The center of the planet is unknown, but visitors can decide if they want to explore. The Exosphere is a frigid -234 degrees Fahrenheit, but the core, on the other hand, can get up to 43,000 degrees Fahrenheit. A day lasts only 10 hours, but a year lasts the equivalent 12 Earth years. Jupiter has 79 moon that can be visited. The most famous are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiter is a fast spinning and exciting place to observe and study. </p>

									<h3>What to Pack</h3>
									<p>Jupiter has a very extreme atmosphere with wind up to 385 miles per hour, making travel difficult. Packing for all types of weather is recommended. We sell all the necessary items for travel if you don't have them at home.</p>
									<ul>
										<li >Extreme windbreaker (pro version for extreme wind)</li>
										<li >Space suit - with oxygen mask and heat/cold protection</li>
										<li >Jetpack - of course</li>
										<li >Books - its a long trip</li>
										<li >Space House</li>
										<li >Ogygen-hrydro tank - for breathing outside</li>
										<li >Space equipped camera</li>

									<h3>Planet Attractions</h3>
									<p>When traveling to Jupiter you must see the most popular attractions. Among the most visited sites are The Great Red Spot, the volcanos on the moon Io, and the northern pole of the planet where you can view an incredible light show.</p>

												<h4>Great Red Spot</h4>
												<p>The Great Red Spot is the most iconic place on Jupiter. It is wide enough it fit 2 Earth's and has winds up to about 400 mph. The Great Red Spot has been spinning for about 150 as far as we know. Right now the Great Red Spot is huge mystery mostly because of Jupiters atmosphere, the fact that there is no ground, and that are telescopes can only see clouds high in the atmosphere.</p>

												<h4>Moons</h4>
												<p>Jupiter has the most moons of any planet in our solar system by a lot. There are 79 moons in total with 53 of them being named. Some of the most famous ones are Io, notable for its volcanos, Europa, with its icy surface, and others such as Gaymed and Callisto.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Light Shows</h4>
												<p>Light shows are visible at the north and south pole. The lights are created by Jupiter's huge magnetic field, which is 20,000 times the strength of Earth's, and the moon Io which releases large quantities of sulfur and oxygen. These factors produce an unforgettable sight to see.</p>

									<h3>Wildlife</h3>
									<p>The sole inhabitant on Jupiter is Marvin the Martian from Lunny Tunes. He has adapted to withstand Jupiters harsh conditions because he has a protective suit and helmet that allows him to live with extreme temperatures and wind. With no oxygen on Jupiter Marvin breaths hydrogen, the main element found in Jupiter's atmosphere. He is vey strong despite his small size. His wings allow him to live in the inner part of the planet, which is important because there is no surface - it is all gas. As a child he grew up on the moon Europa. Finding food was challenging because nothing lives on Jupiter so he would eat almost anything he could find. When he is in the inner part of the planet his diet mostly consisted of ammonia ice found on the top of the clouds. Over the centuries Marvin and his descendants adapted to the harsh living conditions on Jupiter by being smart, resilient, and resourceful. They welcome tourist and donations.</p>
