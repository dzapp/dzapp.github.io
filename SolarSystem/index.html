										<h2>About Jupiter</h2>
										<p>The largest planet in the Milkey Way<br />
										Untouched. Unexplored.</p>
									</header>
									<p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the Milky Way by far. 1,300 earths could fit in Jupiter just for size. It is 498,710,653 miles from the sun lying 5th from the sun and the first of the gas giants. Taking about 640 days (over 1.5 years) to get to Jupiter from earth it is quite a long trip spanning 365,366 miles. Once you get there you will find the 4 layers as you get farther in; the exosphere, Thermosphere, Stratosphere, and Troposphere in the center. The whole atmosphere is made up of Hydrgoen and Helium. Each layer is categorized by pressure and temperature. Ammonia clouds causing the lightning are formed in the stratosphere and thermosphere. In the center of the planet is unknown to us but you can decide for yourself what you think it is. The exosphere is a frigid -234 degrees Fahrenheit and the core gets up to 43,000 degrees Fahrenheit . A day last only 10 hours but a year last 12 earth years. There are also many, many moon that Jupiter Tours can take you too. The most famous of the 79 of them are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto . Itâ€™s a fast spinning exiting place to visit.</p>

												<h4>Great Red Spot</h4>
												<p>The Great Red Spot is the most iconic place on Jupiter. It is wide enough it fit 2 earth's with winds up to about 400 mph this is not just a spot. The Great Red Spot has been spinning for about 150 as far as we know. Right now the Great Red Spot is huge mystery mostly becuase of Jupiters atmosphere, the fact that there is no ground, and that are telescopes can only see clouds high in the atmosphere.</p>

												<h4>Light Shows</h4>
												<p>An incredible sight to see are at both poles of the massive planet. From Jupiter's huge magnetic field that is 20,000 times the strength of Earth's and many other factors these incredible auroras appear in both the north and south pole. They are caused by Jupiter's ability to produce it's own auroras and one of its moons Io that releases sulfur and oxygen at a huge rate. All of these factors lead to an icredible tourist attraction.</p>

									<h3>Inhabitants</h3>
									<p>The main inhabitant on Jupiter is known best described as a flying fish of sorts. It is named this because of how it breaths, as in not breathing oxygen, how it handles pressure, and much more. On its shell there is a protective exoskeleton that can withstands the extreme heat and cold of the planet. It breaths the hydrogen in the air through its gill on both sides. It is a very strong animal being able to live in the extreme winds of the inner planet but it raised as a child one of many particular moons. It thrives off of almost anything that lives in Jupiter's orbit. When they are little they eat the organisms that live on some of the moon and when they are adults they mostly eat/drink the ammonia ice found on the tops of the clouds. Over the centuries they have adapted to be able to live on these harsh conditions and because of the living conditions of Jupiter they are one of the only animals on the planet. </p>
