<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px" align="center">History of Central Region East - AZA</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px">On a long forgotten day, in a long forgotten year, 
in a citadel far far away, a Jewish Congress known as the Aleph Zadik Aleph of 
the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization was founded to form a more perfect union, 
establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, 
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves 
and our posterity and ultimately become manly men.&nbsp; In this ever evolving scene 
of warfare between our archrivals, the B'nai B'rith Girls, we underwent 
structural changes to our executive board.&nbsp; The holy position of Godol was 
created by Aleph Ben Doverstein to allow us to use nuclear weapons because only 
the president can order the use of weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; Unfortunately 
our attempt to destroy the congress of BBG intelligence officers at Roswell, New 
Mexico did not work because we overlooked a very important fact... cockroaches 
can survive nuclear wars.&nbsp; We were again thwarted recently when we used 
city-sized hovering space vehicles armed with super lasers to destroy large 
epicenters of BBG's on July 4th.&nbsp; We were thwarted because Will Smith and Jeff 
Goldblum, one of our own young Jewish men, destroyed our mother ship aka. Matt 
Goldfine's ass and because movies aren't real (Tell you the truth our first 
mistake was to trust a South African with a spear in a loincloth to lead the 
order).&nbsp; Our next great chapter began when we sent a trusted ape and her 
companion to the Congo to find a diamond to use as part of a super weapon.&nbsp; The 
mission was drawing to an end when our last great leader's insullin pump went 
off.&nbsp; At first we thought we were doomed because the BBG's heard the pump go 
off... WE were wrong, they knew we were here becuase someone fooled around with 
their midget.&nbsp; We immediately used the giant gremlin to scare them away while 
our own fat midget ate our way to freedom, but at the end of the tunnel there 
was a cliff.&nbsp; Our only way down was to the our special weapon, The Fro, as a 
rope down.&nbsp; We were again shutdown by ugly ape looking things known as BBG's.&nbsp; 
We nearly destroyed ourselves after that mission, but we flew to the moon in the 
most unlikely vehicle - a big boy holding a giant Christmas ham.&nbsp; This operation 
was known as the Allen Parson's Project or the Austin Power's Experience.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately our current great leader, Steve Samuel Herst aka. Aristotle 
Kaplan, has ordered us to return to earth for more steroids and to complete our 
ultimate mission... to destroy the B'nai B'rith Girls.&nbsp; With our new leaders, 
Elliot &quot;I ate dirt to save us once&quot; Hunker, Geoff &quot;My Dixie Wretched and now it 
has diabetes&quot; Schoenberg, Matt &quot;My ass is our new mother ship&quot; Maisel, and Ben 
&quot;My Freakin' Puerto Rican Hair is for some Freakin' Puerto Rican Charity&quot; 
Rivera, We plan to take over the world and destroy the B'nai B'rith Girls.</p>
