      Raiders for losing in the playoffs.&nbsp; I had tickets to the Superbowl, 
      fools… why would I go now?&nbsp; You know Mr. T’s comin’, so why you gonna go 
      and lose?</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">9. I pity the fool that 
      leaves a flyer on Mr. T’s windshield. If Mr. T wants to join your health 
      club, Mr. T will come to you.&nbsp; He don’t need your jibba jabba to tell him 
      to come see you.&nbsp; Fools.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. I pity the fools that take drugs.&nbsp; Hugs 
      are better than drugs, but Mr. T don’t give hugs ‘cept to his momma.&nbsp; So 
      guess what I’m gonna do to you, sucka?&nbsp; You guessed it, I’m gonna beat 
      your ass.&nbsp; By the time I finish with your sorry ass, you’ll be wishing 
      those crack rocks you been smokin’ was Pez.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. I pity the following cable networks: 
      TNT, Comedy Central, Sci-Fi, and TNN.&nbsp; You know why?&nbsp; Cause they keep 
      showing Mr. T the same damn movies over and over and over.&nbsp; There are a 
      million movies out there, but they gotta show the same five every week.&nbsp; 
      Mr. T’s tired of watching the Goonies, Cheech &amp; Chong and Pumpkinhead2.&nbsp; 
      You fools better show me something different.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. I pity the fool that don’t like milk.&nbsp; 
      Did you know that milk is full of vitamins and minerals, along with being 
      chock full of calcium?&nbsp; How do you think Mr. T got so big?&nbsp; Do you think 
      Mr. T just ate somethin’ that made him magically grow into a fine 
      asskickin’ machine?&nbsp; No, sucka.&nbsp; Mr. T drank his milk.&nbsp; And if Mr. T 
      drinks it, you better damn well drink it too… if you don’t, I pity you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. I pity the fools at Enron for stealin’ 
      all those people’s money.&nbsp; No wonder you’re blowin’ your brains out left 
      and right.&nbsp; It’s better to be dead than be pitied by Mr. T, cause that’s a 
      world of hurt.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. I pity the fool at McDonald’s that 
      don’t supersize Mr. T’s combo for free.&nbsp; Don’t act like you’re taking an 
      order from a bum.&nbsp; You know you’re taking an order from Mr. T.&nbsp; And Mr. T 
      ain’t paid for nothin’ extra since 1982.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. I pity Mike Tyson.&nbsp; Why you gotta go 
      and start bitin’ people again?&nbsp; All that says to me is that you can’t 
      fight so you gotta do dirty stuff.&nbsp; You just full of jibba jabba.&nbsp; I got 
      half a mind to come beat your ass myself.&nbsp; No, I got a whole mind to.&nbsp; 
      I’ll be there in a few minutes, sucka.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. I pity the fool who farts in elevators 
      and act like he didn’t just fart.&nbsp; You know you farted.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Mr. T’s in 
      the elevator with you.&nbsp; Why you gonna make him smell that nasty stuff, 
      sucka?&nbsp; Goin’ up or goin’ down, you betta not be goin’ nowhere if you 
      can’t hold it.&nbsp; And I mean that, sucka.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. You guessed it, I pity that sucka fool 
      Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; He’s in for a helluva asskickin’ when I find him… and 
      oh, yes, Mr. T will find him, even if it means I gotta search every damn 
      cave and taxi cab in the world.&nbsp; Ain’t no sucka gonna kill Americans and 
      make Mr. T scared to get on a plane.&nbsp; Mr. T was never really scared of 
      planes til you got hold of one.&nbsp; Now Mr. T’s gotta take the bus.&nbsp; That 
      ain’t right, and I know you’re wrong.&nbsp; Sucka, you betta look out.&nbsp; You may 
      have bin runnin’, you may have bin hidin’, but Mr. T’s gonna wipe his ass 
      with your face before it’s all over with.</font></td>
